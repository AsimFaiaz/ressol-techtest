<p>2. In the terminal type: " npm run start " or " npm start "</p>
<p>3. The program will start to run in the browser</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Avoid common debugging errors</h2>
<p>Make sure you are in the same directory where the application stored. Directory can be changed using "cd" in the terminal. For example: PS C:\Projects> cd ressol-techtest </p>
<p>In the terminal type: " npm run build " which will build directory with a production build of the app</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Deployment</h2>
<p>I used Cloudflare to deploy the app</p>
<p>Reasons: Quick and easy to deploy, Handy for sprints and version control specially when testing </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Extra works</h2>
<p>I added "Edit/Delete/Update" buttons from my side which was not mentioned to do. I did the buttons just to make the app visually look good and fill the white-spaces in the form. <em> Note: Functionality not implemented for the buttons. </em></p>
